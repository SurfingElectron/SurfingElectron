### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, and a little bit of HTML and CSS.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on coding Fortunes and Winds, a dice game from the RPG "Legend of the Five Rings". The eventual aim is to turn this into a Discord bot so people can play/use it in a server.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here! I have a twitter account, but I keep forgetting to check it. ;)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 💪 "*Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.*" - Winston Churchill
