#### About Me
I'm a former therapy radiographer who's come full circle and returned to my younger self's interest in tech. I love learning new things, solving problems, and working with people. All things I got to do as a radiographer, which I'm now applying to my journey in tech!

#### 
- üñ•Ô∏è I‚Äôm currently developing with React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
- üå± I'm learning about component libraries, noSQL
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on: 
  - Fortunes and Winds, a dice game from the RPG "Legend of the Five Rings". The eventual aim is to turn this into a Discord bot so people can play/use it in a server;
  - Pokemon Top Trumps using the PokemonAPI;
  - A tarot card reading app, to create and save tarot card readings.
- üì´ How to reach me: Here! I have a twitter account, but I keep forgetting to check it. ;)
